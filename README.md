# BankSystem-Application
💻 I’m excited to share my latest project — Bank System Application, developed using Core Java, Advanced Java (JSP &amp; Servlets), HTML, CSS, and Oracle Database. Through this project, I gained strong hands-on experience in web development, database connectivity using JDBC, and server-side programming on Apache Tomcat 9.
